                <h1>About Organic Store</h1>
                <p>An Shabha organic store sells organic, natural, and eco-friendly products, often without pesticides, preservatives, or artificial flavors. Organic food is grown without synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides and fertilizers, and does not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic food includes fresh produce, meats, and dairy products as well as processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals. Organic stores may also offer locally sourced and sustainably grown products. Organic food is often fresher because it doesn't contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is sometimes produced on smaller farms nearer to where it is sold. 
                    Organic agriculture is based on four principles: health, ecology, care, and fairness. Organic agriculture involves several interconnected elements such as soil quality, minimizing energy use, water pollution and pesticide use, nutritional quality, and employment of workers. It's a food retailer that specializes in organic, natural and eco-friendly products. The products available at an organic grocery store are often free of pesticides, preservatives, and artificial flavors.Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible. Produce can be called organic if it's certified to have grown on soil that had no prohibited substances applied for three years prior to harvest.
